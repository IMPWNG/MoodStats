## Why did I build it ?

I believe that all the answers for our problems has already been found. And thank to AI it's now possible to find them in a matter of seconds.

By writing our thoughts, we can find the answers to our problems. But it's hard to find the answers in a sea of thoughts. That's why I built this application.

Mental health is a big problem in our society. And I believe that this application can help people to find the answers to their problems.

By writing your thoughts, it's easier to analyse true the data what's going on in your mind. Thanks to AI, you can get a report about your thoughts.

## What is it about ?

This application acted like a personal analyst for the user. It allowed the user to enter their personal toughts, rate and categoryze them, then it would analyze the data and give the user a report about their tougths. 

- Number of entries
- Number of entries per category
- Number of entries per rating
- Average rating
- Average rating per category
- ...

The user could also see the data in a graphical form, delete entries and edit them.

## AI Implementation

The AI was implemented using ChatGTP API (3.5 turbo). The promps was trained to act like a personal analyst. The user could enter their thoughts and the AI would analyze them and give the user a report about their thoughts.

It also have a pholisophical mode, where the chat give the user a philosophical point of view about their thoughts.
